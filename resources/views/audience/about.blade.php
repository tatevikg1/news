        <strong class="mt-5">The history of the company.</strong>
        <p>
            The New York Times (NYT; sometimes also known as The Times) is an American newspaper based in
            New York City with worldwide influence and readership. Nicknamed the Gray Lady,
            the Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".
            The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of
            the front page. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 130 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other
            newspaper; s well as being ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
            The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded and is controlled by the
            Sulzberger family, which has owned it since 1896, through a dual-class share structure.A. G.
            Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper's publisher and the company's
            chairman, respectively—are the fourth and fifth generation of the family to head the paper.

        </p>
        <p>
            Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has greatly expanded its layout and organization, adding
            special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and
            features. Since 2008, the Times has been organized into the following sections:
            News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times,
            Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features. On Sundays, the Times is supplemented
            by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review), The New York Times Book Review, The New
            York Times Magazine , and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Times stayed with the broadsheet full-page set-up and an eight-column format for several
            years after most papers switched to six, and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color
            photography, especially on the front page.
