        <strong>The history of the company.</strong>
        <p>
            The New York Times (NYT; sometimes also known as The Times)[6] is an American newspaper based in
            New York City with worldwide influence and readership.[7][8] Nicknamed the Gray Lady,[9]
            the Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".[10]
            The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of
            the front page. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 130 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other
            newspaper;[11][12] s well as being ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.[13]
        </p>

            The paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded and is controlled by the
            Sulzberger family, which has owned it since 1896, through a dual-class share structure.[14]A. G.
            Sulzberger and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.—the paper's publisher and the company's
            chairman, respectively—are the fourth and fifth generation of the family to head the paper.[15]

            Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has greatly expanded its layout and organization, adding
            special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and
            features. Since 2008,[16] the Times has been organized into the following sections:
            News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times,
            Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[17] On Sundays, the Times is supplemented
            by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review),[18] The New York Times Book Review,[19] The New
            York Times Magazine ,[20] and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.[21]

        </p>

            The Times stayed with the broadsheet full-page set-up and an eight-column format for several
            years after most papers switched to six,[22] and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color
            photography, especially on the front page.[23]
